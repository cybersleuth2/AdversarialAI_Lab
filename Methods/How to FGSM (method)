✅ How to Run fgsm.py from the methods/ Folder
Activate your virtual environment (if not already activated):
source venv/bin/activate

Run the FGSM script from the root of your lab directory:
python3 methods/fgsm.py

The script will:
	Load the MNIST dataset.
	Train a tiny CNN (if no saved model is found).
	Apply the FGSM attack.
	Print predictions on clean vs. adversarial images.
	Save a sample image comparison (fgsm_adversarial_example.png) in the root directory.  User can review and create a folder to save, accordingly.


Look for:Terminal logs showing accuracy before/after the attack.

─$ python3 methods/fgsm.py

## TROUBLESHOOTING

PROBLEM:  python3 methods/fgsm.py  gives a NumPy error.
REASON: NumPy 2.2.5 is not compatible
SOLUTION: Downgrade to the latest 1.x version
  pip uninstall numpy
  pip install numpy==1.26.4   (or 1.24.4, if needed)
      Successfully installed numpy-1.26.4 
  run python3 methods/fgsm.py again
      [INFO] Training a small model first...
      [INFO] Model trained and saved.
